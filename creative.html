          <p>Following the election of President Trump, women across the world mobilized against a new leader who has been repeatedly accused of sexual assault and a regime whose campaign promises included overturning Roe v. Wade. “A lot of women didn’t think we had to worry about things like our reproductive rights, but here we are, and it turns out we do,” For All Womankind founder Deva Pardue told Magenta shortly after she launched the design initiative, which donates all of its proceeds to Emily’s List and The Center for Reproductive Rights.Like Pardue, many women have focused their efforts on building communities that empower females in creative fields, using beautiful design, strong networks, and programming that connects women to potential employers and collaborators. And while our political climate alone is arguably enough to initiate change, AIGA’s recent design census— whose 9,500 participants showed an average $10,000 pay gap between male and female designers and a lack of females in senior positions—is more proof of the continuous need to increase the visibility of female designers and artists.To honor International Women’s Day, Magenta gathered some of our favorite creative initiatives intended to empower females working in art and design.</p>

          <p>n creative process, there are always some points of choice and contradictions. While UX designers are debating about Photoshop vs Sketch theme and give their opinions on efficient prototyping tools, iOS developers also have their own big debate. Today we are going to pitch in and add some of our thoughts to this global discussion of which programming language is better, Objective-C or Swift. We asked Tubik CTO and experienced iOS developer Maria Nazarenko to share her opinion with Tubik Blog readers.Brief background
Let’s start with a tiny bit of history. The first and therefore the eldest in the discussed pair of programming languages was Objective-C. Primarily it saw the light of the day in early 1980s and was created by Brad Cox. So, one of the points that could be definitely applied to this programming language is that it’s really tried-and-true and tested by several generations of developers.
At the moment Objective-C is commonly described as the general-purpose, object-oriented programming language adding Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language. Before Swift came into play, Objective-C had been the main programming language used by developers for OS X and iOS operating systems, and their APIs.
Swift, introduced at Apple’s 2014 WWDC, brought its own dose of revolution. In general description, Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language broadening the previous scope of operating systems as it was developed for iOS, OS X, watchOS, tvOS, and Linux. Swift was designed to enable work with Apple’s Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks as well as the large body of Objective-C code already written for Apple products.
Initially Swift was intended to be more resilient and safer than Objective-C, and also more concise and developer-friendly. It was built with the LLVM compiler framework including in Xcode 6 and using the Objective-C runtime library that enables C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within one program. Therefore, it enhaces broadening professional horizons for developers making their work more efficient.
That was the milestone when developers started their discussion of what is better, tradition or innovation.</p>

          <p>The dream is to create a “WOW Experience” for your users on their first visit to your website. One of the best analogy I have come across that explains the importance of this is from Kevin Hale (Founder of Wufoo), who spoke at ZURBsoapbox. He claims that the very first customer experience is like being on a first date
So if you’re on a first date and you find out that your date starts picking their nose in the beginning of dinner, there will be no second date. But if you’ve been married to someone for years and they start digging for gold, you don’t immediately divorce them right away. There is something different once the relationship is already established.I am sure most of you can see the truth in that statement. So now that we know, creating an amazing first experience for the user is paramount, let us think about how to go about doing it. Your website design as a whole will leave a lasting impression on your visitor. You can use some small UI changes to your existing site, to make a lasting impression.
When you think about it some of the most common ways the visitor interacts with you on your website will be via the contact form to get in touch with you, the login box to register an account on your site, or when they sign up for your newsletter to know when you will launch you awesome product, etc.
So it’s very likely they will end up using a form or some sort of input field like a text box. So today we are going to look at some really cool form and input field designs that will help you WOW your customers.</p>

          <p>Apple has historically targeted creatives with its “Pro” line, and many of you might be looking at elementary OS for your new daily setup. There are really two categories of people here: those who do new, original creative work, and those who are doing development but working alongside a designer.
						First, if you’re doing photo manipulation, vector design, or page layout, Gimp (photo editor), Inkscape (vector design tool), and Scribus (page layout/publishing) are all very capable tools. They’ve improved leaps and bounds in the past few years, so if you’ve used them in the past and weren’t a fan, they may be worth trying again. They’re all available right from AppCenter.
Many high end commercial applications are also available for elementary OS, like Bitwig Studio for audio production and Lightworks for video editing.
There are also several apps available in AppCenter that cater to more specific use cases, like Krita or MyPaint for digital painting. It’s always worth checking out what’s available.
However, if you absolutely, 100%, definitely require Adobe or Mac-only software for your process, I have some blunt news: you’re not going to be able to use those apps in elementary OS for the time being. If Adobe or the developers of those Mac apps built elementary OS versions, you’d have a chance, but that’s not the case right now.
There are definitely compatible apps and formats, though. Gimp can open and export to PSD while Inkscape can open AI files and export to Illustrator-compatible PDF or SVG formats. Cross-platform apps like LibreOffice can open and save to Microsoft Office formats.
And you can still definitely dual-boot with macOS or Windows, or install a VM like VirtualBox and run those other OSes, but that’s a bit outside of the scope of this series. :)
Working with a Designer
If you’re simply working alongside a designer, I have some great news! I work with two Adobe-using designers almost daily: Kate at System76 and my wife. I never have to worry about using the same tools as them, and I believe it makes for higher quality, more reusable work.
Most of the time the designer simply exports her assets (or layers of asset, depending on the end result) as extremely high resolution PNGs, and I can assemble the web page assets from there. For resizing/“making web safe”, I either use a script as part of the asset pipeline, or just open in Gimp and save out the necessary sizes. PNG saves losslessly, so I know I’m starting from the highest quality and can save out to a smaller PNG or JPG depending on which is a better fit.
Occasionally I need to get exact values from a design file, in which case I open the PSD or AI file in Gimp or Inkscape respectively. Not every filter, gradient, or blend mode always works exactly the same, but it does allow me to get a general look at the design and extract colors, sizes, and dimensions if needed.
I’ve been doing this for over two years at System76 and even longer at home (for random side projects), and it’s a really great workflow. We are constantly complimented on the design and implementation of the System76 site, and I think a lot of that is due to the workflow we established with me, the developer, on elementary OS.
We’d like to say thanks again to our supporters on Bountysource and Patreon, those who’ve purchased a copy of elementary OS or merch from our store. Every contribution helps make all of this possible, and we wouldn’t be here without you! If you’d like to help improve elementary OS, don’t hesitate to Get Involved!
